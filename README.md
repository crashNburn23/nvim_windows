This is my personal nvim config for windows

Notes: 

There were multiple dependencies that I had to go through to get this set up for windows. Some of them are included below: 
- choco install ripgrep
- choco install mingw
- pip install ujson (after installing Microsoft C++ build tools) - this fixed insalling python through mason
